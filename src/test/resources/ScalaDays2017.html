<h3><strong><br />Pre-Conference Community Events</strong></h3>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.bridgetroll.org/events/354" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ScalaBridge, Tuesday May 30, 09:00 - 17:00</a><br /></strong>ScalaBridge is a fun and friendly introduction to Scala, with an explicit goal of encouraging diversity in the Scala community.&nbsp;To coincide with Scala Days, a ScalaBridge will be held in Copenhagen at Bella Center on Tuesday, 30th of May, from 9am to 5pm. It's completely free to attend, but you need to <a href="https://www.bridgetroll.org/events/354" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">register here</a>.<br /><br />We ask that attendees have a bit of programming experience (any language is fine) and are from a group that is underrepresented in the Scala community, broadly interpreted.<br />If you are an experienced Scala developer, and interested in helping out as an instructor, we also want to hear from you.<br /><br />ScalaBridge has three goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>To have fun! Always the most important goal at ScalaBridge. Our curriculum is based around expressing your creativity through computer graphics. It is explicitly designed for people who don't have the science / engineering / maths background that is typical of programmers.</li>
<li>To show that programming is a systematic task. If you follow some recipes you can't go wrong.</li>
<li>To set you up for future learning. We want to provide you with enough background that you can pick up other programming material (and particularly functional programming material) and not feel completely lost.</li>
</ul>

The focus of Scala Sprees is to introduce newcomers and veterans alike to open source! Come meet contributors of well-known open source Scala projects and learn how you can make your own contribution.

<h2>Scala Days Copenhagen</h2>
<p>Scala Days, the premier Scala Conference, will be held this year at <a href="http://www.bellacentercopenhagen.dk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bella Center</a> in Copenhagen. Trainings will be on May 30th - 31st, 2017, and the conference will be held from May 31st - June 2nd, 2017. The conference will start after the trainings - so don't panic, you can attend both training and conference! There will also be a&nbsp;<a href="http://event.scaladays.org/scaladays-chicago-2017" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Scala Days US</a>&nbsp;at the <a href="http://www.swissotel.com/hotels/chicago/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Swissotel</a>&nbsp;in Chicago on April 18th - 21st, 2017.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The conference will bring together developers from all corners of the world to share their experiences and new ideas around creating applications with Scala and related technologies, like Akka and Play Framework. Scala Days provides a unique opportunity for Scala users to interact with the contributors to the language and related technologies and connect with fellow developers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Leaders from Scala User Groups and communities around the globe, students and language contributors, will gather to discuss academic research, use-cases and visionary projects for a two day, action-packed event.<br /><br />Last year&rsquo;s conferences in New York and Berlin were sold-out events!</p>

<p>Martin Odersky created the Scala programming language and is a professor in the programming research group at EPFL, the leading technical university in Switzerland. Throughout his career, Martin's singular objective has been to make the basic job of writing programs faster, easier and more enjoyable. In the process, he has personally written more lines of Java and Scala code than almost any other individual in the world. He wrote javac, the compiler used by the majority of today's Java programmers, and scalac, the compiler used by the fast-growing Scala community. He authored "Programming in Scala," the best-selling book on Scala. Previously he has held positions at IBM Research, Yale University, University of Karlsruhe and University of South Australia, after having obtained his doctorate from ETH Z&uuml;rich as a student of Niklaus Wirth, the creator of Pascal.</p>

                                  <dd class="abstract"><p>Often when we create a client/server application, we need to validate the requests: can the user associated to the request perform this operation? Can they access or modify the data? Is the input well-formed?<br /><br />When the data validation component in our application is not well designed, the code can quickly become not expressive enough and probably difficult to maintain. Business rules don't help, adding more and more requirements to add in our validation, making it more and more complex to clearly represent and maintain. At the same time when the validation fails, it should be fairly straight forward to understand why the request was rejected, so that actions can be taken accordingly.<br /><br />This talk introduces Cats, a Scala library based on category theory, and some of its most interesting components for data validation. In particular we'll discuss some options to achieve efficient and expressive data validation. We will also argue that, compared to other options in the language, Cats is particularly suited for the task thanks to its easy-to-use data types and more approachable syntax. <br /><br />Throughout the talk, you will see numerous examples on how data validation can be achieved in a clean and robust way, and how we can easily integrate it in our code, without any specific knowledge of category theory.</p></dd>

Since 2008, he has guided and trained enterprise teams on the transformation to distributed computing. In recent years he is focusing primarily on production systems that embrace the reactive application architecture, using Akka, Play Framework, Scala and Java to this end.<br /><br />Manuel likes to travel and is a frequent speaker at international conferences. He lives in Vienna where he is a co-organizer of the Scala Vienna User Group. Next to thinking, talking about and fiddling with computers he likes to spend time with his family, run, scuba-dive and read.

Given the prevalence of frameworks over toolkits and models in the industry, it is easy to forget that the former will not prevent you from using them in any way you please &ndash; including ways that are possibly suboptimal or perhaps even harmful.<br /><br />In this talk you'll learn about a few of the most common anti-patterns related to Akka usage. You'll also get to know about alternative and more appropriate solutions to use for each one of those anti-patterns. It should be noted that these suboptimal uses of Akka are not merely theoretical ponderings but real and recurring observations that the speaker made during a range of consulting projects.</dd>

It is remarkable that the two communities coexist happily, and I believe there is a valuable lesson to be learned here, because the Scala community is also split along a much more divisive axis: the language aficionados looking to exploit the language to its fullest, and the "blue collar" developers striving for simplicity.<br /><br />I've lately come to the realization that this apparent bifurcation of the community, if managed carefully and its challenges tackled head-on, is actually a GOOD thing because it means we get the best of both worlds: crazy-powerful libraries alongside a practical, productive language for your everyday job! In this talk I'll outline what I think these challenges are, and hopefully start a discussion on how to solve them.</dd>

                                  <dd class="abstract">In July 2015 Facebook released the first draft of GraphQL specification. <a title="GraphQL" href="http://graphql.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GraphQL</a>&nbsp;provides an alternative to the REST API with a high emphasis on efficient data retrieval and introspection with a powerful type system behind it. It allows you to build the client applications based on highly decoupled components without sacrificing performance or over-/under-fetching a data. GraphQL is ideal for any application that requires very precise and performant data fetching/manipulation, like mobile applications. GraphQL type system is not only a perfect fit for scala applications, but it also opens a door for a brand new set of tools for API discovery, documentation, and code generation. In this talk I would like to give an introduction to GraphQL - the concepts behind it and how it addresses common API design challenges like versioning, documentation, and discovery. You will learn how you can start using GraphQL today in your scala applications with <a title="Sangria" href="http://sangria-graphql.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sangria</a>&nbsp;- a scala GraphQL implementation.</dd>

                                  <dd class="abstract">One of the main advantages of Scala is that it is a powerful functional programming language. Functional programming typically emphasizes programming with first-class functions and immutable data. Immutable data types enable fault tolerance in systems like Apache Spark, and ensure safe message exchange in Akka, among many other applications. However, beyond the distinction between vals and vars, Scala's type system does not have a built-in notion of immutability for type definitions. As a result, it is not possible to require, say, the generic type of a method parameter to be immutable (e.g., using a marker trait or a context bound). Instead, immutability is "by-convention" in Scala, and statistics about the use of immutability in real-world Scala code are non-existant.<br /><br />This talk reports on the results of an empirical study on the use of immutability in medium to large open-source Scala projects, including but not limited to Scala's standard library. The study investigates both shallow and deep immutability, two widely-used forms of immutability in Scala. Perhaps most interestingly, for type definitions determined to be mutable, explanations are provided for why neither the shallow nor the deep immutability property holds; in turn, these explanations are aggregated into statistics in order to determine the most common reasons for why type definitions are mutable rather than immutable. Last but not least, this talk presents a plug-in for the Scala compiler, scala-immutability-plugin, which you can use to gather statistics on immutability in your own Scala projects.</dd>

                                  <dd class="abstract">This talk will introduce the audience to writing gRPC applications in Scala using ScalaPB. gRPC is a modern, high-performance, open-source RPC framework focused on the requirements of connecting polyglot services in microservice-oriented systems. Its support of HTTP/2, protocol buffers, bi-directional streaming and type-safety make it an attractive alternative to traditional REST/JSON based service communication. gRPC support for Scala is available through ScalaPB - a community provided protocol buffer compiler that can be smoothly integrated into the sbt development workflow. Once integrated, ScalaPB will automatically generate the source code required for the implementation of the defined services and messages, as well as stubs for both synchronous and asynchronous clients. This talk will start with a short introduction to gRPC and its principles, followed by live coding examples of setting up gRPC with ScalaPB and implementing services and clients using various forms of gRPC communication styles, such as single request/response and bi-directional streaming. As a bonus - and if time allows - there will also be a demonstration about how to integrate gRPC with Akka Streams.</dd>

It&rsquo;s not uncommon for a project to experience compilation times of a handful of minutes, if not worse. On top of that, compilation times are unpredictable, depending on a combination of language features, external libraries, and type annotations. A single line change may increase compilation times ten fold.<br />What can we do? It&rsquo;s paramount we gain greater insight into the tools and libraries we use. There are also established (anti-)patterns that you should know about, if you fancy to keep compilation times to a minimum. And why not utilizing all cores when compiling? The stock Scala compiler can&rsquo;t do it, but Triplequote Hydra is here to change that. Sit tight and let&rsquo;s cut down on compilation time!</dd>

                                  <dd class="abstract">Due to Spark, writing big data applications has never been easier... at least until they stop being easy! At Lightbend we've helped our customers out of a number of hidden Spark pitfalls. Some crop up often; the ever-persistent OutOfMemoryError, the confusing NoSuchMethodError, shuffle and partition management, etc. Others occur less frequently; an obscure configuration affecting SQL broadcasts, struggles with speculating, a failing stream recovery due to RDD joins, S3 file reading leading to hangs, etc. All are intriguing! In this session we will provide insights into their origins and show how you can avoid making the same mistakes. Whether you are a seasoned Spark developer or a novice, you should learn some new tips and tricks that could save you hours or even days of debugging.</dd>

And there are great libraries in the Scala eco-system to support these use cases: Akka-Stream, fs2, Monix,... But if you look under the hood and try to understand how those libraries work you might be a bit scared by their complexity!<br /><br />In this talk you will learn how to build a very minimal "streaming library" where all the difficult concerns are left to other libraries: eff for asynchronous computations and resources management, origami for extracting useful data out of the stream. Then you will able to decide how to spend your complexity budget and when you should pay for more powerful abstractions.</dd>

Through a sequence of simple examples we will attempt to characterise the relative pros and cons of each technique, where they are most appropriate, and where they might turn around and bite you.<br /><br />We can solve many Scala programming problems using simple tools: algebraic data types, higher order functions, and type classes. Sometimes our code can become verbose or unwieldy, and we have to search for ways to make it cleaner and more maintainable.<br /><br />"Meta-programming" is a broad term describing techniques for generating code using code. It often provides the key to eliminating boilerplate, but the meta programming techniques listed above could not be more different. Identify the best meta-programming technique can be they key to saving hours of frustration attempting to go down blind alleys. This is the problem we will solve in this talk.<br /><br />The talk is aimed at intermediate Scala developers who have a basic awareness of each technique. You don't need to know shapeless or macro programming to benefit.</dd>

He will show architectural and implementation choices to implement distributed systems in vehicle IoT, reliable medical messaging, biometric security, and video streaming. The talk will cover everything from good Scala code, through best practices in use of Akka (Persistence, Cluster, HTTP, Streaming): highlighting the need for asynchronous I/O and messaging, while managing the complexity of implementation, debugging and monitoring, distributed state and the implication of maintaining distributed state particularly when it comes to consistency, all the way to documentable and expressive protocols and APIs.<br /><br />Come to Jan's talk if you are about to start a large-scale microservices system and wonder what potential challenges await you: learn how to make the most of the Lightbend&nbsp;stack ecosystem of tools and frameworks, together with the necessary infrastructure to keep the system running. The examples Jan will show, together with the code on his GitHub repository, will give you the needed boost&mdash;years of consultancy experience&mdash;to your microservices project.</dd>

While many developers are happy and comfortable using ADTs when provided from the language or a library, they often don't see the steps to take the next leap in creating ADTs for their own domain.<br /><br />In this talk we will take a look at just what ADTs can do for you, covering some common classes that you don't even realise are ADTs from the standard library and also some well-known libraries, revisit pattern matching, and understand how the compiler can help us with techniques such as folding. Finally, we will develop a brand new collection type using our new-found knowledge.</dd>

A startup guy, by day he's been helping with projects for powering the next generation energy grid solutions and for advancing the health-care industry. By night he's fueled by his work on the Monix project, the Scala library for composing asynchronous and event-based programs. He's also a proud father, husband, has a very unhealthy sleep schedule and appreciates talking about programming over beer. Sometimes he blogs at <a href="https://alexn.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://alexn.org</a></dd>

                                  <dd class="abstract">Scala&rsquo;s Future from the standard library is great, but sometimes we need more. A Future strives to be a value, one detached from time and for this reason its capabilities are restricted and for some use-cases its behavior ends up being unintuitive. Therefore, while the Future/Promise pattern is great for representing asynchronous results of processes that may or may not be started yet, it cannot be used as a specification for an asynchronous computation.<br /><br />The Monix Task is in essence about dealing with asynchronous computations and non-determinism, being inspired by the Scalaz Task and designed from the ground up for performance and to be compatible with Scala.js/Javascript runtimes and with the Cats library. It also makes use of Scala&rsquo;s Future to represent results, the two being complementary.<br /><br />In this talk I&rsquo;ll show you its design, when you should use it and why in dealing with asynchronicity it&rsquo;s better to work with Task instead of blocking threads.</dd>

They allow developers to write programs by relying on other programs whose implementation details are unknown. But the more about these programs is unknown, the more difficult it is to manipulate and combine them in a correct (and useful) way.<br />This talk will explore the solutions brought by existential types and their encoding in Scala. You will learn what they can do and what they can not throughout concrete use cases, and how they compare to other alternatives for modularization (e.g. &ldquo;basic&rdquo; inheritance and typeclasses).<br />No theoretical background is required.</dd>

                                  <dd class="abstract">In this talk, we give an overview over a project that we are conducting at SAP. The goal of this project is to build a Scala-based application development stack that enables developers to easily build cloud applications that integrate with SAP systems. The application development stack we are building embraces Scala all over the place &ndash; including the development of user interfaces for which Scala.js is utilized to provide a type-safe interface to SAP's own JavaScript UI library SAP UI5. Our stack is tailored to the needs of application developers who work within the SAP ecosystem and focuses on simplicity, for instance, provided by embedded domain-specific languages.<br /><br />After a brief overview of how we are using Scala within our project at SAP, we deep dive into one particular subproject that we also recently released as an open-source library called "Dive". The library provides functionality for functional-reactive programming as descriped in Ingo Maier and Martin Odersky's article 'Deprecating the Observer Pattern' from 2010. We use this library within our UI library.</dd>

                                  <dd class="abstract">Cloud computing, reactive systems, microservices: distributed programming has become the norm. But while the shift to loosely coupled message-based systems has manifest benefits in terms of resilience and elasticity, our tools for ensuring correct behavior has not grown at the same pace. Statically typed languages like Java and Scala allow us to exclude large classes of programming errors before the first test is run. Unfortunately, these guarantees are limited to the local behavior within a single process, the compiler cannot tell us that we are sending the wrong JSON structure to a given web service. Therefore distribution comes at the cost of having to write large test suites, with timing-dependent non-determinism.<br /><br />In this presentation we take a first peek at ways out of this dilemma. The principles are demonstrated on the simplest distributed system: Actors. We show how parameterized ActorRefs &agrave; la Akka Typed together with effect tracking similar to HLists can help us define what an Actor can and cannot do during its lifetime&mdash;and have the compiler yell at us when we do it wrong.</dd>

This might be the first time you ask your team members to play a game during work hours.<br /><br />In this talk, we will showcase our work in progress with ScalaQuest, and share our experience building it - our design decisions and the challenges we've faced. We will then focus on the technical challenges related to compiling user-submitted code on the server side while trying to keep a snappy UI.<br />--<br />(1) or will be, at some point in the future, hopefully.</dd>

At Lightbend he's part of the core Akka team, and has contributed mostly (but not only) to the core, persistence, new remoting as well as maintaining Akka HTTP. In the past he's helped startups write high performance service backends as well as huge corporations such as eBay get started with Scala. His favourite discussion topics range from distributed systems and high performance algorithms to photography and capybaras. He has founded and run multiple user groups (Java, Scala, Computer Science, ...), and is part of program committees of awesome conferences such as GeeCON and JavaOne SF. In those rare times he's not coding, he spreads the joy of computer science by helping local user groups and whitepaper reading clubs. He also holds number of titles, including the "Best ScalaDays NY talk 2016" and Java One RockStar 2015.</dd>

With the new exciting modules like Akka Streams, Akka HTTP (including the most recent HTTP/2 work) and the new remoting reimplementation codenamed Artery, we've stepped into the era of Akka 2.5 already. Which again, remains backwards compatible as previous releases. What's in there, and what's next for Akka in general?<br /><br />In this talk we'll take a brief look back at the newest stable modules of Akka itself, as well as new projects such as Alpakka. Next, we'll continue with the (then present) 2.5 version and the stable Persistence Query, high-availability CRDT support in Distributed Data and continued work on the Artery remoting. Finally we'll have a sneak peek at what's coming in the next releases, which among other things include Akka Typed and more!</dd>

The main topics of this talk will be:<br />- a walkthrough for the current stack and available modules<br />- bootstrapping an SBT-Vert.x-project with the provided project blueprint<br />- running, testing and deploying of Vert.x-microservices<br />- how Scala enhances the Vert.x programming experience<br />- a full demo of an elastic Vert.x-cluster <br /><br />Expect a lot of code and room for discussions.</dd>

Everything is in place that defines a successful open source project - or isn't it?<br /><br />This talk tries to highlight some of the key questions software developers will quickly be faced with when dealing with open source: In addition to coding skills, topics like people management, naming, trademark enforcement, licensing, patents, pr and more become topics to deal with.<br />After years of using open source projects, running my own projects, founding meetups and conferences, watching others thrive or fail I believe that coding skills alone aren't sufficient to turn a "private play ground code base" into an open source project that other's can rely on.<br /><br />Inspired by 140 characters of truth published <a href="https://twitter.com/janl/status/712593518015987712" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>&nbsp;the talk will focus on what topics that are usually not taught as part of programming courses will cross your way when dealing with open source - either as a user or as a contributor:<br />
<ul>
<li>People: Is the project willing and able to attract more contributors? Is it able to survive if the leader looses interest or time to continue contributing? How does the project deal with requests coming from the user base? How easy is it for users to get their issues fixed?</li>
<li>Trademarks: Why should you care about trademarks from the beginning? How do you deal with others infringing on your trademarks?</li>
<li>Copyright: Why should you care, exactly which license you choose?</li>
<li>PR: While writing release notes is common practice and composing changelogs is pretty easy, the resulting documents are hard to grok for editors and won't get you on the front page of any magazine. Nor will they help you get visibility on common social media systems that might be key in informing your users about recent releases.</li>
</ul>
While being excellent at all topics isn't vital from the start, answers to governance questions decide what a project looks like a few years from it's start.</dd>

FP is a well defined approach to writing programs that we will uncover in this talk. It is a style that long predates Scala and many of the modern abstractions that are often referred to as "essential" tools.<br /> <br /> We will walk through the origins of FP, providing historical context through Lisp and the research that brought us this paradigm. We'll define what FP is and what it is not, looking at how tools like purity and immutability enable the expressions at the heart of FP.<br /> <br /> Finally we'll talk about practical approaches to Functional Programming in Scala, how you can and why you would use this style in your everyday work. This will _not_ be a talk about monads and type systems, but give you a pragmatic look at how to separate the syntactic sugar from the underlying principles.</dd>

If you&rsquo;ve never even heard of them, don&rsquo;t worry: This talk will give an quick introduction to the concepts of Event Sourcing and CQRS from the ground up. <br /><br />Once the basics are clear, we are going to have a close look on a Scala framework for these patterns: The Lagom Persistence module that comes as part of the Lagom Microservices Framework. Not only will you see how Lagom makes it easy to use these patterns with Scala, you will also understand what happens under the hood.<br /><br />Lastly, we&rsquo;ll look at some challenges that you may face when applying these patterns, as well as have a quick overview of alternative implementations and what to look for when comparing the approaches.</dd>

He has a background in systems engineering and a degree in Mechanical Engineering from Georgia Tech. He&rsquo;s an active contributor to open source projects such as Scala Exercises, Cats, the Scala compiler, AsyncDisplayKit for iOS, and Scala Bot. And he recently authored Case Classy, a tiny framework for simplifying the process of decoding untyped structured data into case class hierarchies. In his free time, Andy teaches CrossFit and likes to travel.</dd>

It shouldn't be this way.<br /><br />Case classy is a small library that makes part of this process easier. Case classy makes loading and decoding configuration data&mdash;usually strings&mdash;much easier. It prevents all-or-nothing runtime errors and instead provides a rich and comprehensive error data type for when this process goes wrong.<br /><br />In this talk we will introduce Case Classy, showing how to use it and its benefits over other configuration libraries. We will dive into the functional programming foundations and how this enables us to assemble and combine decoders so that errors accumulate. And we will look at how Shapeless and generic programming can automatically assemble decoders for us and save us from an abyss of boilerplate.</dd>

He will dive into propositional and predicate logic and show how they relate to testing. He'll explain where he thinks property-based testingfits in the big picture, and give demos of some new and exciting features currently being developed for ScalaTest and Scalactic.</dd>

Each solution has its Pros and Cons that we will visit and discuss in detail.</dd>

We built an initial Akka Actor implementation but didn&rsquo;t ask ourselves the key question: What happens when you have actors with vastly different performance characteristics? <br /><br />We will look at how we built two distinct services using Akka Actors, how Akka helped us parallelize, parse and send data to our data ingestion service, and why we hit the limits of this system. You will walk away with a greater understanding of backpressure and Akka Streams, warning signs to look for when your actor system may be near it&rsquo;s capacity, and when Akka Streams is a good choice for your data transfer system.<br /><br />If you and or your company have or are building Akka Actor Systems, designed for high throughput this talk may be for you. We will provide guidance on best practices and whether optimizations can improve throughput or whether switching to Akka Streams may be necessary.</dd>

During his studies and his later career he became a distributed system affectionado with a special interest in model checking. He is always happy to share his insights into how to apply theoretical concepts in a pragmatic fashion to real-world problems. Daniel is both a co-organizer and regular speaker at the Berlin Scala User Group.</dd>

                                  <dd class="abstract">Did you ever implement an asynchronous/distributed algorithm or data structure and wondered whether your implementation is correct? Did you ever try to solve this problem by testing thoroughly and a little bit of reasoning with the result being &ldquo;the system will probably work correctly&rdquo;? If you answered to any of these question with yes then this talk is definitely for you.<br /><br />In this Talk we will look at a novel approach to easily prove the correctness of concurrent/distributed systems with the help of an extension for ScalaTest. The extension offers a DSL for describing behaviors of these systems and employs explicit state model checking for the purpose of proofing those behaviors. Since, model checking isn't widely used in the Scala world we will (briefly) discuss this concept before looking at the DSL and extension itself. In the demo we will see that the extension can be used for proofing the correctness of a real-world system written in Scala.<br /><br />Monads will not be mentioned during this Talk. However, the audience may be exposed to a non-painful amount of temporal logic.</dd>

                                  <dd class="abstract">Akka is a great toolkit for a concurrent and resilient system, even if it's in Android. The BONX outdoor group-talk Android app is a VoIP -Voice over Internet Protocol- client for the extreme sports scene. It is an audio stream processing client app that has unique requirements such as fewer packets and resiliency.<br /><br />Since it is expected to run continuously during sports activities, which can be up to 7 hours for skiing or snowboarding, it should, therefore, minimize packets with some additional steps which may make BONX more complex. It should also be able to recover from any errors that occur during the activities, including network disconnection, hardware I/O errors and any other failures in each module. Akka works greatly to manage these types of errors.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />The BONX app, which is built using Akka, detects failures in each module, and suspend or restarts the connection depending on its network environment, or recover from errors immediately without spoiling the user's experience. That's why the BONX app is rated almost five stars as of January 2017 at <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.bonx.go" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Play</a>.<br />&nbsp;<br />This talk is not just an introduction to a unique use case, but also demonstrates how Akka is a powerful and easy toolkit that can be used to ensure resiliency and concurrency in a minimal system.</dd>

On one hand, the tool is essential for features such as automatic dependency management, continuous compilation, testing, and deployment, etc. However, it&rsquo;s often that we find hours are wasted on trying to fight sbt and the way it dictates our build processes. In this session, Jeff will show fellow Scala developers how to regain their productivity by both embracing sbt instead of fighting it as well as finding new ways to use sbt beyond just a build tool. Past users of Maven, Ant, and Gradle may not feel comfortable configuring and customizing their sbt build definition -- much to their own detriment -- but the potential to do so is definitely there. Accompanied by specific and compelling case studies, Jeff will challenge the audience to re-think the ways they have been using sbt all along and walk away with specific best practices to improve their overall productivity with the tool.</dd>

                                  <dd class="abstract">There is no shortage of AI startups today that are productizing methods in specific domains to solve problems in a repeatable way. While this frequently works in areas with very consistent data sources and fixed fields, many companies still struggle to create operational models in their business domains. Challenges also remain around building organizations capable of in-house development, largely due to a shortage of individuals for hire.<br /><br />At Salesforce, Einstein addresses this need by truly democratizing AI. In this talk we will cover how we are reducing the human effort for our customers to solve cases in their service centers by building models on their data in Service Cloud. We will describe the underlying framework enabling models specified for each of our individual customers and return results back to massively decrease the time it takes to solve cases.<br /><br />In describing the approach we will provide an overview of the platform and how it enables our customers at every step. This will include how we specify timeliness of data ingest, automation of feature engineering, model selection and tuning specific to each customer via Optimus Prime, and making the model immediately actionable by pushing the results back to Service Cloud. The platform overview will emphasize how various components function and result in scalable services by leveraging technologies such as AKKA, Spark, SparkML and the AWS lambda architecture. Through this we will demonstrate how Einstein accelerates the process of developing operational models and brings AI to all our customers.</dd>

                                  <dd class="abstract">At any company&rsquo;s start, they will face of the decision of which programming language will define their technology stack. For Tapad, this was in 2010, when languages like Scala were in their very early stages and many engineers weren&rsquo;t looking beyond Java. It was at that time that CTO and co-founder, Dag Liodden, made the decision to use Scala, which arguably provided the technical foundation needed to scale Tapad to what it is today -- a 200+ person company, managing 20+ PB of data, that was recently acquired for $360 million. While adoption has gained significant momentum for Scala since Tapad first embraced the language, it is still in the fairly early stages of maturity, which poses challenges for experienced and novice Scala developer teams alike. In this session, Dag will address the source of some of these challenges, how they can be resolved, and how Scala can help deliver high quality code at high velocity. Ultimately, all leading up to how engineers and entrepreneurs alike can overcome these barriers to build a team, or even a whole company, on Scala.</dd>

There is a lot said and done about consistency in a distributed system and this talk focuses on building a system that favors high availability over consistency. To build highly available systems you have to sacrifice consistency when partitioning occurs. A Conflict-Free Replicated Data Type (CRDT) is a datatype that allows nodes in a distributed system to replicate data to each other without conflicts. Akka has a module to use make use CRDT's to distribute data over your cluster. This module is called Distributed Data.<br /><br />This talk will give an introduction to Distributed systems, data replication and how CRDT's work. This will serve as a basis to explain Akka Distributed Data. At the end a short demo will show it working.</dd>

These libraries have several disadvantages. For a start, they require switching environments. Furthermore, they often lack useful abstractions, being either easy to use or flexible, but not both. For example, matplotlib provides a rigid system of predefined graphs, while d3 provides many low-level building blocks but lacks tools to easily combine them for common graphs.<br /><br />Doodle is a new 2D visualisation library for Scala. It can render graphs on the desktop, to files (PDF and PNG), and, using Scala.js, to the browser as SVG. In this talk I will briefly describe how to use Doodle for common tasks, and then delve into its architecture. I'll show how standard functional programming techniques allows Doodle to provide powerful functionals at multiple levels of abstraction, yielding a library that is both easy to use and extremely flexible.</dd>

A string interpolator which parses and checks a DSL at compile-time -- with its own custom error-messages -- can be written using contextual in just a few lines of ordinary "userspace" code, calling upon parsers, regular expressions or any other means to check the interpolated string.<br /><br />This opens up a smorgasbord of possibilities for adding more compile-time safety to Scala code, not least the ability to introduce your own literal-like types, ranging from checked email addresses or URLs to compile-time-checked YAML, CSS or Haskell!</dd>
