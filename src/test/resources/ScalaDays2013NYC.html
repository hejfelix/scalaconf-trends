					<h2><strong>Thank you from the Scala Days 2013 Team!</strong></h2>
					<p>On behalf of the entire Typesafe team, a huge thanks to all who attended the fourth annual Scala Days conference last week! We had such a fantastic time with the community, attending sessions and jamming out during our live karaoke concert in the Hudson Theatre. We hope you enjoyed yourself, found the sessions informative and valuable and had the opportunity to meet and chat with members of the community.</p>

					<p>For those of you who were unable to attend the conference or some of the more popular sessions, Parleys will upload all keynote videos and session recordings in the coming weeks; we’ll update the community once they are complete! We’ve also created a Facebook album with some photos from our time in NYC; if you haven’t done so already, please “Like” us on Facebook, check out some pictures from the event and tag yourselves! There are some awesome shots from the keynotes, various parties and presentations.</p>

					<p>At Scala Days we launched a new version of Typesafe Activator that enables anyone to contribute templates which developers can use to learn and explore new technologies.  Already we have thirteen templates in Activator with more on the way!  Check them out and contribute your own!</p>

					<p>Lastly, a big thanks to all our speakers and sponsors for supporting the conference, we could not have pulled together such an exciting and engaging event without you! We hope you found the conference beneficial and hope you will continue to be involved in the community for years to come!</p>

					<p>As Martin Odersky mentioned in his keynotes, let’s continue highlighting the simplicity of Scala, making it the language of choice for those picking up new languages.  </p>

					<p>Thank you, from your Scala Days team at Typesafe!</p>

						<p class="description">Scala gives you awesome expressive power, but how to make best use of it? In my talk I will discuss the question what makes good Scala style. We will start with syntax and continue with how to name things, how to mix objects and functions, where (and where not) to use mutable state, and when to use which design pattern. As most questions of style, the discussion will be quite subjective, and some of it might be controversial. I am looking forward to discuss these topics with the conference attendees.</p>

								<h2>Going Reactive: Scalable, Highly Concurrent & Fault-Tolerant Systems</h2>
								<p>
						            The skills of building Scalable, Highly Concurrent, Event-driven and Resilient Systems are becoming increasingly important in our new world of Cloud Computing, multi-core processors, Big Data and Real-Time Web. Unfortunately, many people are still doing it wrong; using the wrong tools, techniques, habits and ideas. In this talk we will look at what it means to 'Go Reactive' and discuss some of the most common (and some not so common but superior) practices; what works - what doesn't work - and why.

								<h2>A Walk Down the Beach, How Kiama Helps Implementing Distributed Collections on Top of Hadoop</h2>
								<p>
									This talk will give you an brief overview of the BigData tooling landscape and where Scoobi, a distributed collection Scala library for Hadoop, stands.
									Then we'll see what are the challenges in translating Scoobi abstractions to Hadoop constructs and how Scala, as programming language, and Kiama (<a href="http://code.google.com/kiama">http://code.google.com/kiama</a>), as a graph-processing library, can be leveraged to support this translation.
									In particular, we'll show:<br/>
									- How rewriting rules based on partial functions are a very succinct way to pre-process the computation graph and to optimise it.<br/>
									- How attribute grammars can be used to implement general graph traversal algorithms<br/>

						<h2>Simple API Design, Lessons Learned</h2>

								<h2>Simple API Design, Lessons Learned</h2>
								<p>
									Scala is one of the most feature rich, expressive and flexible languages around at present. It offers more ways to solve a problem than virtually any other language around, since it mixes Object Orientation, Functional Programming, Static Typing and much more.<br/>
									The down side of all this power and functionality is all too commonly observable in the libraries available for Scala. Many libraries forget the audience for whom they are being written, and instead expose details like the underlying model (which may be very clever, but should mostly be orthogonal to the resulting API and certainly should not directly affect it). To put it another way, if your database structure dictates your user interface or web page, something is wrong with the design of your site (too many failed model driven design projects back this assertion). In the same way, APIs that are dictated by the innermost workings of your library have likely failed to take into account the needs of the user.<br/>
									While writing SubCut, and further enhancing the feature set for SubCut 2.0, I learned many lessons about the advantages of teasing apart your semantic model from your library API. This is not a talk about SubCut, but a talk about some of the techniques I used to provide what I believe is the smallest, simplest and most streamlined API, while hiding most of the details of the implementation. I can also speak to the advantage of that approach with the enhancements made in SubCut 2.0 - the small targeted API let me change much about the inner workings, and while the API was affected for some new features, the new features were always added in a way that kept the API familiar to current users, and more importantly provided an easy, often non-breaking transition path.

								<h2>Confessions of a Ruby Developer Whose Heart Was Stolen by Scala</h2>
								<p>
									Ruby has a long history of "making the developer happy" by allowing for ease of programming and prototyping. Rails has taken off by storm and allowed startup companies to quickly create web applications that solve features required by the business. However, recently the Ruby community has realized that scaling Ruby in the real world can be a challenge due to the lack of type safety, the global interpreter lock, lack of a robust threading library, and the general lack of focus on performance in the Ruby world.<br/>
									<br/>
									In this talk my goal will be to illustrate how I've made the transition from the dynamic programming world of Ruby to the type safe and highly async/concurrent world of Scala and Akka. I think that Ruby developers shy away from Scala due to its static type safety and lack of understanding of its powerful and expressive features. I want to illustrate how Scala does a much better job at allowing the developer to be expressive while avoiding common pitfalls with Ruby (e.g., Ruby's dynamic mixins vs. Scala's type safe trait mixins). I will use examples from my own redis_failover project and illustrate how using Scala could've saved me at times.<br/>
									<br/>
									The Ruby/Rails community currently has a huge force behind it, and I think that some of these users will make the transition to Scala/Akka/Play with the proper illustrative comparisons and knowledge.

								<h2>Big Data Analytics with Delite</h2>
								<p>Traditionally in order to write applications that run across heterogeneous hardware, programmers must manually combine code for multiple programming models together in ad-hoc ways. Domain-specific languages (DSLs) offer an alternative approach, as high-level implicitly parallel domain abstractions can be transparently lowered to multiple heterogeneous architectures. Delite is a framework for building high performance DSLs embedded in Scala.  This talk will describe how we have extended Delite to run single-source, implicitly parallel DSL applications across clusters of machines of CPUs and GPUs.  Using examples from existing Delite DSLs for data querying and machine learning, we will show how we can achieve high performance with a flexible high-level programming model using a set of powerful compiler analyses and optimizations.  Finally we will compare Delite's performance with Hadoop and Spark across of set of applications.</p>

						            As the focus of modern web applications shifts to be more and more about providing rich user experiences, and hardware evolves not to be faster but to provide more and more CPU cores, many web frameworks have been left behind, unable to meet the demands of a modern web application.  At the same time, demands for web applications continue to become more complex, with more services required to be written faster.<br/>
						            <br/>
						            Play Framework is the answer to these new demands, providing first class support for current web standards such as WebSockets and technologies such as LESS, requireJS and CoffeeScript, while providing the power of asynchronous IO and parallel processing using simple and concise Scala syntax on the backend.  It does this while allowing you to produce applications quickly, scaling your development by providing everything working out of the box and ready to go.  This presentation will give you a taste of just how simple Play Framework makes modern web application development, showcasing support for the latest technologies in a development environment that is powerful and productive.

								<h2>The Spark Stack: Fast and Expressive Big Data Analytics in Scala</h2>
								<p>As big data becomes a concern for more and more organizations, there is a need for both faster tools to process it and easier-to-use APIs. Spark is a Hadoop-compatible cluster computing engine that addresses these needs through (1) in-memory computing primitives that let it run 100x faster than Hadoop and (2) a concise and high-level Scala API that can be used both in standalone programs and interactively from the Scala shell. Increasingly, Spark is also being used to power a stack of higher-level computing frameworks, including Shark, a port of the Hive SQL engine, and GraphX, a graph computing package that can describe algorithms like PageRank in a few lines of code. In this talk, we'll introduce the Spark ecosystem, focusing on Spark's native Scala API and GraphX. We'll also cover use cases from Spark's open source community, which has grown significantly since we released the project in 2010 -- in the past year, 15 companies have contributed code to Spark.</p>

								<h2>Project Lancet: Surgical Precision JIT compilers</h2>
								<p>
									Profile-driven JIT compilers like those in most JVMs provide good
									performance on average, but they are a black box with highly
									nondeterministic behavior. Thus, achieving top performance,
									predictably and consistently, is very hard.

									This talk will present Lancet, a research JIT compiler written
									in Scala that allows the running application to take full control
									of the JIT process. This includes the ability to compile multiple
									specialized versions of code paths at runtime, which is key
									for removing abstraction overhead of high-level, generic code.

									Another key feature of Lancet are JIT macros, which enable execution
									of user code at JIT-compile time and thus open the door for "smart
									libraries" that come with domain-specific optimizations and checks.
									Unlike Scala macros, JIT macros are not a front-end system, but
									tightly integrated with regular JIT compiler optimizations and
									VM functionality like speculative optimization and re-optimization.

								<h2>Practical type mining in Scala</h2>
								<p>As the author of an open-source serialization library in Scala, I've undergone a lot of struggle to understand and harness the power of Scala's type system.  My library was based on parsing pickled Scala signatures, which was a subterranean and sparely documented feature of Scala 2.8.  I wanted to serialize and deserialize options, lists and maps, which required defeating type erasure when serializing while skating by on type erasure when deserializing.  I struggled with multiple constructors, checking for annotation types, specialization, more.  The new reflection libraries introduced in Scala 2.10 provided easier access to the same information I had been getting from the pickled signatures.  This talk will address practical aspects of type mining, providing a library of hands-on examples using the Scala 2.10 reflection API.</p>

								<h2>Scala for Data Pipelines</h2>
								<p>Scala's mix of functional and object oriented programming paradigms is ideal for building data pipelines. Many smart people have noticed this, and as a result, we now have three distinct APIs for creating MapReduce pipelines in Scala (Scrunch, Scoobi, and Scalding), as well as a standalone data processing framework developed purely in Scala (Spark). Although all of these tools showcase the power and elegance of Scala, there is a larger opportunity for the community to give pipeline developers a single API to use for both in-memory and batch-style data processing. We'll discuss some of the challenges in creating an API that balances the features of both in-memory and batch processing and demonstrate the benefits that this creates in ETL development, exploratory data analysis, and machine learning.</p>

								<h2>Realtime Web, The Urge for a Programming Model</h2>
								<p>
									Realtime Web Applications are applications making use of Websockets, Server Sent Events, Comet or other protocols to offer an open socket between the browser and the server for continuous communication. Several web frameworks target the development of this type of applications but they mostly feature a basic API that allows developers to push/receive messages from/to an open channel:
									channel.push(message)
									//and
									channel.onMessage { callback }
									These APIs fall short when it comes to manipuling a rich set of streams of data, which is central to the Realtime Web model. It presents indeed several challenges in terms of creating, adapting, manipulating, filtering and merging streams of data as well as in terms of synchronization involved.
									To respond to this challenges, it is crucial to have a programming model that identifies clearly what a stream of data is and defines composable components to deal with it.
									Play2 uses Iteratees together with Futures for dealing reactively with streams of data, providing a very rich model for programming rich Realtime Web Applications.

									Jan will show how to use RabbitMQ to connect components on different platforms. After a few introductory slides explaining the main concepts, the rest of the talk will be live code. The coding will begin by showing simple Scala / Akka code to connect to RabbitMQ to send and receive messages--think ``java.lang.String`` values back and forth to start with. We will then increase the complexity of the messages and marshal the messages into JSON. Jan will then show the real power of messaging infrastructures by replacing the RPC server component by native code in C++: we will write image processing component. To make matters even better--faster--we will then use CUDA to perform the image processing.<br/>
									<br/>Come to Jan's talk and demo if you want to find out how to use Scala, Akka and RabbitMQ in the core of your application, especially if your application needs to tie together code on completely different platforms and if it performs heavy number crunching or image processing.

								<h2>How Scala and Akka helped build Sirius at Comcast's Interactive Media division</h2>
								<p>
									A case study of how Scala and Akka helped a team of software developers without a whole lot of distributed system programming experience build a fairly sophisticated, production quality distributed system with a custom multipaxos implementation at its core.  The name of the system is Sirius, and we're using it to power the next generation of our API layer at Comcast's Interactive Media division.<br/>
									<br/>
									The talk will focus on how we use'd Akka and Scala to build the core of the system.<br/>
									<br/>
									Our basic approach was to read up on all the Paxos literature we could find.  We then took the psuedocode in "Paxos Made Moderately Complex" and translated it wholesale into straightforward Scala using functions and tuples.  Then we slowly massaged that code into something cleaner using case classes before moving it into Akka actors.  Finally, we went through that naive implementation to optimize our usage of memory and network resources to finish the core Paxos implementation.<br/>
									<br/>
									We've had this running in production for about half a year now with only minor issues.  Given that we had very limited experience with distributed systems, this a major miracle that we couldn't have pulled off without Akka.

								<h2>Taming the Cake Pattern with Type Macros</h2>
								<p>
									In this talk, we discuss some interesting extensions to the cake pattern as described in <a href="http://jonasboner.com/2008/10/06/real­world­scala­dependency­injection­di">Real­World Scala: Dependency Injection (DI)</a> by Jonas Bonér. We consider the use of the cake pattern to express hierarchical components, and the high­level design constraints between them. We also discuss encapsulating the details of a composite component.<br/>
									<br/>
									The cake pattern suffers from three major problems that limit its adoption:<br/>
									1. Verbosity: Lots of boilerplate.<br/>
									2. Opacity: Hard to follow the code because the language idioms used do not signify the user's intent.<br/>
									3. Compiler error messages are confusing.<br/>
									<br/>
									We present a specification for a suite of type macros to address the problems of verbosity and opacity. We provide a status report on the implementation of these macros to date.

To do all these, I used a myriad of technologies from Scala IDE, sbt, and giter8 to git, Android, and Play! In the process, I learned a lot more about Scala's features such as traits, iterators, streams, lazy vals, implicit classes, and typeclasses.<br/>
									In this talk, I will share a few games, Android apps, and algorithms that show how Scala made implementing complex programs simple. I will also demonstrate a few awesome Minecraft mods written in Scala and a "mind blowing" project.

								<h2>On Pickles and Spores: Improving Scala's Support for Distributed Programming</h2>
								<p>
									Despite unifying frameworks like Akka, distributed systems often look like a patchwork of special-purpose tools, libraries, and frameworks. For example, the essential task of persisting objects by pickling (or serializing) them to a binary or text representation is typically outsourced to a third-party serialization framework. Many of these frameworks, like Google's Protocol Buffers, lack support by the Scala compiler or integration with the Scala standard library, resulting in suboptimal performance, unsatisfying Scala support, or both. Furthermore, to obtain good performance using one of these frameworks, it's often necessary to roll your own type-specialized custom serializers, requiring significant boilerplate.

									This talk presents a new pickling framework designed for Scala with a few attractive properties: (1) using the framework requires little to no boilerplate, (2) using Scala's implicit parameters, users can add their own easily-swappable pickle format enabling users to persist to a number of formats, binary, JSON, or your own custom format, (3) using the type class pattern, users can provide their own custom picklers to override the default behavior of the pickling framework, (4) static, macro-based generation of picklers enables significant performance improvements. In microbenchmarks our framework achieves a factor 6 speedup over Java Serialization, and performs on par or up to 3 times faster than popular fast Java serialization frameworks like Kryo. We'll show how this new framework can be used as a drop-in replacement for other serialization frameworks, and what's in store for Java compatibility.

									Finally, we'll present an experimental abstraction, called spores, well-behaved, composable pieces of functional behavior that can be cleanly pickled, transported over the wire, unpickled, planted, and more.

								<h2>Using Spring in Scala</h2>
								<p>The Spring Framework is one of the most popular Java frameworks used today. While it is possible to use Spring in Scala, it does feel awkward in certain places, because of the "Javaism" peering through. For instance, using callback interfaces feels strange in Scala; functions would be a better match. In October 2012, I introduced the Spring Scala project, which solves this particular issue, and aims to make it easier to use Spring in Scala in general. In this session, we discuss the Spring Scala portfolio project and its feature set.</p>

						        <p>Ever wished the compiler could make asynchronous programming easier? Enter Scala Async. Do asynchronous I/O like “normal” blocking I/O, program with Futures and Promises even more naturally! Scala Async makes it possible to “suspend” at arbitrary points in a block of regular Scala code, and to “resume” from that point later— all without blocking. This not only makes it possible to make concurrent code look sequential, it makes it possible to actually use even the most unfamiliar asynchronous libraries in a familiar blocking style. What’s more, not only does it come out-of-the-box seamlessly integrated with Scala 2.10’s new Futures and Promises API, but you can also easily use it with any other event-driven Scala or Java library of your choice.</p>

								<h2>Spark Streaming: Fast Distributed Stream Processing with a High-Level API</h2>
								<p>Spark Streaming is a new extension to the Spark cluster computing framework that enables high-speed, fault-tolerant stream processing through a high-level Scala API. It builds on a new execution model called "discretized streams" to provide exactly-once processing without the heavy cost of transactions required by previous systems (e.g. Storm), allowing it to process significantly higher rates of data per node while still recovering from faults in seconds. It also greatly simplifies stream programming by providing a set of high-level operators (e.g. maps, filters, and windows) in Scala. Perhaps the most exciting feature of Spark Streaming, however, is that it combines seamlessly with Spark's interactive and batch processing features, allowing ad-hoc queries on stream state and programs that combine streaming and historical data. Spark Streaming scales linearly to 100 nodes and has been used to build applications including session-level metrics reporting and online machine learning.</p>

								<h2>Expanding eta-expansion: shapeless polymorphic function values meet macros</h2>
								<p>
									Polymorphic function values are one of the key abstractions in
									shapeless: they are crucial to enabling sequence-like operations such
									as map, flatMap and filter to be performed on HLists (data structures
									which combine the heterogeneous typing of tuples with list-like
									characteristics). Their encoding in Scala has been refined over a
									number of iterations, but remains a little heavyweight relative to the
									syntactic ease with which ordinary monomorphic functions or
									polymorphic methods can be defined. In this talk I will show how we
									can use macros to automatically promote polymorphic methods to
									polymorphic function values and how that improves the usability of
									shapeless.

Topics will include how and when to write microbenchmarks, the intrinsic speed of various common library routines, the pitfalls of the first-get-it-working-then-run-the-profiler mode of optimization when performance really matters (and how to let the profiler help you), and patterns to favor when you know a priori or via profiling or benchmarking that performance is critical.</p>

The purpose of this presentation is to show how some of these methodologies, from Natural Language Processing and Hermeneumatics, can be successfully applied to the Maya hieroglyphic writing system thanks to the power and versatility of Scala. In particular, the research framework presented here makes extensive use of the facilities that Scala provides to build external Domain Specific Languages that epigraphers can use both to provide accurate transcriptions and transliterations of hieroglyphic texts, and to query the linguistic corpora for quantitative and qualitative analyses.</p>

								<h2>One API to rule them all</h2>
								<p>
									Designing a REST API for multiple applications and devices is typically an exercise in trade-offs. A single API offers efficiency in terms of building and maintenance costs; specialised APIs, though tedious to build, can be optimised for each particular use-case, removing unnecessary computational overheads.

									At Time Out (http://www.timeout.com/), we are experimenting with a Graph-based approach that takes full advantage of Scala's functionality to provide the best of both worlds: an optimised and flexible API with no boilerplate.

									In this talk, we discuss how your domain can be modeled as a graph and introduce Shona, a library which facilitates integration of data from heterogeneous data sources and links it together in a consistent and flexible Graph API. We compare Shona with other approaches (LinkedIn, Netflix and Facebook) highlighting its strengths along with possible areas for development.
