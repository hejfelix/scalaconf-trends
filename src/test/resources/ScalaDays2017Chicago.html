<h2>Scala Days Chicago</h2>
<p>Scala Days, the premier Scala Conference, will be held this year at <a href="http://www.swissotel.com/hotels/chicago/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Swiss&ocirc;tel</a>&nbsp;in Chicago. Trainings will be on April 18th - 19th, 2017, and the conference will be held from April 19th - 21st, 2017. The conference will start after the trainings - so don't panic, you can attend both training and conference! There will also be a&nbsp;<a href="http://event.scaladays.org/scaladays-cph-2017" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Scala Days Europe</a>&nbsp;at the <a href="http://www.bellacentercopenhagen.dk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bella Center</a>&nbsp;in Copenhagen on May 30th - June 2nd, 2017.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The conference will bring together developers from all corners of the world to share their experiences and new ideas around creating applications with Scala and related technologies, like Akka and Play Framework. Scala Days provides a unique opportunity for Scala users to interact with the contributors to the language and related technologies and connect with fellow developers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Leaders from Scala User Groups and communities around the globe, students and language contributors, will gather to discuss academic research, use-cases and visionary projects for a two day, action-packed event.<br /><br />Last year&rsquo;s conferences in New York and Berlin were sold-out events!</p>

<p>Martin Odersky created the Scala programming language and is a professor in the programming research group at EPFL, the leading technical university in Switzerland. Throughout his career, Martin's singular objective has been to make the basic job of writing programs faster, easier and more enjoyable. In the process, he has personally written more lines of Java and Scala code than almost any other individual in the world. He wrote javac, the compiler used by the majority of today's Java programmers, and scalac, the compiler used by the fast-growing Scala community. He authored "Programming in Scala," the best-selling book on Scala. Previously he has held positions at IBM Research, Yale University, University of Karlsruhe and University of South Australia, after having obtained his doctorate from ETH Z&uuml;rich as a student of Niklaus Wirth, the creator of Pascal.</p>

Modern programming languages offer an array of constructs to define context. In Scala, those constructs can be summed up as the three I's: Imports, Inheritance, and Implicits. Implicits in particular are a central, but also controversial part of the language.<br /><br />This talk explores the different facets of implicits in Scala, as they exist now and as they might evolve in the future. It highlights their potential benefits and problems, covering aspects of design, implementation, and ergonomics.</dd>

He received his PhD from Northeastern University, where he studied programming language design, program verification, and low-level concurrency. His dissertation was awarded the SIGPLAN John C. Reynolds Doctoral Dissertation Award in 2014. After his PhD studies, he continued his research in concurrency verification and programming techniques as a postdoc at MPI-SWS. He joined Mozilla in 2014, and has played an active role in Rust's development since then.</dd>

It gives you low-level control and predictability but also provides the safety and ergonomics of languages like Scala. The secret sauce is Rust's core notion of "ownership", which enables:<br /><br />- Memory safety without garbage collection.<br />- Concurrency without data races.<br />- Abstraction without overhead.<br /><br />In this talk, I'll explain ownership and show how Rust uses it to guarantee thread safety, amongst other things. I'll say a bit about integrating Rust code with other languages. And I'll also cover some of the lessons the Rust community has learned in how to do open, consensus-driven language evolution, so that we also achieve:<br /><br />- Stability without stagnation.</dd>

FP is a well defined approach to writing programs that we will uncover in this talk. It is a style that long predates Scala and many of the modern abstractions that are often referred to as "essential" tools.<br /> <br /> We will walk through the origins of FP, providing historical context through Lisp and the research that brought us this paradigm. We'll define what FP is and what it is not, looking at how tools like purity and immutability enable the expressions at the heart of FP.<br /> <br /> Finally we'll talk about practical approaches to Functional Programming in Scala, how you can and why you would use this style in your everyday work. This will _not_ be a talk about monads and type systems, but give you a pragmatic look at how to separate the syntactic sugar from the underlying principles.</dd>

Through a sequence of simple examples we will attempt to characterise the relative pros and cons of each technique, where they are most appropriate, and where they might turn around and bite you.<br /><br />We can solve many Scala programming problems using simple tools: algebraic data types, higher order functions, and type classes. Sometimes our code can become verbose or unwieldy, and we have to search for ways to make it cleaner and more maintainable.<br /><br />"Meta-programming" is a broad term describing techniques for generating code using code. It often provides the key to eliminating boilerplate, but the meta programming techniques listed above <br />could not be more different. Identify the best meta-programming technique can be they key to saving hours of frustration attempting to go down blind alleys. This is the problem we will solve in this talk.<br /><br />The talk is aimed at intermediate Scala developers who have a basic awareness of each technique. You don't need to know shapeless or macro programming to benefit.</dd>

A string interpolator which parses and checks a DSL at compile-time -- with its own custom error-messages -- can be written using contextual in just a few lines of ordinary "userspace" code, calling upon parsers, regular expressions or any other means to check the interpolated string.<br /><br />This opens up a smorgasbord of possibilities for adding more compile-time safety to Scala code, not least the ability to introduce your own literal-like types, ranging from checked email addresses or URLs to compile-time-checked YAML, CSS or Haskell!</dd>

When not in San Francisco working as a software development engineer at IBM's Spark Technology Center, Holden talks internationally on Spark (see some selected videos at http://bit.ly/holdenSparkVideos ) and holds office hours at coffee shops at home and abroad. Holden is a co-author of numerous books on Spark including High Performance Spark (which she believes is the gift of the season for those with expense accounts) &amp; Learning Spark. She makes frequent contributions to Spark, specializing in PySpark and Machine Learning. Prior to IBM she worked on a variety of distributed, search, and classification problems at Alpine, Databricks, Google, Foursquare, and Amazon. She graduated from the University of Waterloo with a Bachelor of Mathematics in Computer Science. Outside of software she enjoys playing with fire, welding, scooters, poutine, and dancing.</dd>

This talk introduces &amp; takes a deep dive on Spark's scikit-learn inspired Machine Learning pipelines.<br /><br />Spark's ML pipelines provide a lot of power, but sometimes the tools you need for your specific problem aren't available yet. By integrating your own data preparation and machine learning tools into Spark's ML pipelines you will be able to take advantage of useful meta-algorithms, like parameter searching.<br /><br />Even if you don't have your own machine learning algorithms you want to implement, this talk peels back the covers on how the ML APIs are built and can help you make even more awesome ML pipelines and customize Spark models for your needs.<br /><br />A basic understanding of Spark will make it easier to follow along, but if this is your first Spark talk, this will still be useful and give you a broad understanding of how Spark ML functions (of course since the presenter is an author, if this is your first introduction to Spark she encourages you to buy her book "Learning Spark" &amp; "High Performance Spark").</dd>

                                  <dd class="abstract">Spark is emerging as the leading Big Data platform, and its performance has made impressive progress. But there is still a significant gap towards best-of-breed query engines or hand-written low-level C code on modern server-class hardware. We present Flare, a new back-end for Spark that yields significant speedups by compiling Spark's Catalyst query plans to native code. Flare's low-level implementation takes full advantage of native execution, using techniques such as NUMA-aware scheduling and data layouts to leverage &lsquo;mechanical sympathy&rsquo; and bring execution closer to the metal than current JVM-based techniques on big memory machines. Thus, with available memory increasingly in the TB range, Flare makes scale-up on server-class hardware an interesting alternative to scaling out across a cluster, especially in terms of data center costs. This talk will discuss the design of Flare and will demonstrate experiments on standard benchmarks that exhibit order of magnitude speedups over Spark 2.1.</dd>

We built an initial Akka Actor implementation but didn&rsquo;t ask ourselves the key question: What happens when you have actors with vastly different performance characteristics? <br /><br />We will look at how we built two distinct services using Akka Actors, how Akka helped us parallelize, parse and send data to our data ingestion service, and why we hit the limits of this system. You will walk away with a greater understanding of backpressure and Akka Streams, warning signs to look for when your actor system may be near it&rsquo;s capacity, and when Akka Streams is a good choice for your data transfer system.<br /><br />If you and or your company have or are building Akka Actor Systems, designed for high throughput this talk may be for you. We will provide guidance on best practices and whether optimizations can improve throughput or whether switching to Akka Streams may be necessary.</dd>

                                  <dd class="abstract">In Scala we use the term "type safety", but what it really means? In short, most applications model data types in a form suitable for storage, change, transmission, and use. During the life cycle of the data, we expect to always use the declared type. But reality is a bit more complicated. One of the main practical problems with the use of types occurs when our application interacts with outside world - in requests to external services, different databases or simply with getting data from file. In most cases, an attempt to support type safety leads to writing a lot of code that we always try to avoid. Fortunately we have macros to do all routine job for us! In this talk we will discuss how to use compile-time reflection in library for schemaless key-value database and the benefits of use of macros in production systems.</dd>

On the one hand, the tool is essential for features such as automatic dependency management, continuous compilation, testing, and deployment, etc. However, it&rsquo;s often that we find hours are wasted on trying to fight sbt and the way it dictates our build processes. In this session, Jeff will show fellow Scala developers how to regain their productivity by both embracing sbt instead of fighting it as well as finding new ways to use sbt beyond just a build tool. Past users of Maven, Ant, and Gradle may not feel comfortable configuring and customizing their sbt build definition -- much to their own detriment -- but the potential to do so is definitely there. Accompanied by specific and compelling case studies, Jeff will challenge the audience to re-think the ways they have been using sbt all along and walk away with specific best practices to improve their overall productivity with the tool.</dd>

He will show architectural and implementation choices to implement distributed systems in vehicle IoT, reliable medical messaging, biometric security, and video streaming. The talk will cover everything from good Scala code, through best practices in use of Akka (Persistence, Cluster, HTTP, Streaming): highlighting the need for asynchronous I/O and messaging, while managing the complexity of implementation, debugging and monitoring, distributed state and the implication of maintaining distributed state particularly when it comes to consistency, all the way to documentable and expressive protocols and APIs.<br /><br />Come to Jan's talk if you are about to start a large-scale microservices system and wonder what potential challenges await you: learn how to make the most of the Lightbend&nbsp;stack ecosystem of tools and frameworks, together with the necessary infrastructure to keep the system running. The examples Jan will show, together with the code on his GitHub repository, will give you the needed boost&mdash;years of consultancy experience&mdash;to your microservices project.</dd>

                                  <dd class="abstract">Writing highly performant code has always been a challenge for programmers. Techniques change and evolve in response to shifts in underlying hardware. For example, before the early '90s it was faster to XOR a register with itself than to set a register to 0. This is no longer the case. Instead, creating fast code is mostly about improving L2 and L3 cache hit rates, aligning data in memory and allowing hardware attached to the I/O bus to move data to main memory concurrently with the CPU. Now, with the advent of Scala, use of immutable data has been touted as the best practice for how to write concurrent code. In this talk, we'll discuss why using immutability may not always be the right choice. We'll also cover when to follow easier models reliant on immutability, the best times to brave the difficulties of synchronization and locks, and when blocking is the right thing to do, even inside of an actor.</dd>

Threfore, while the Future/Promise pattern is great for representing asynchronous results of processes that may or may not be started yet, it cannot be used as a specification for an asynchronous computation.<br /><br />The Monix Task is in essence about dealing with asynchronous computations and non-determinism, being inspired by the Scalaz Task and designed from the ground up for performance and to be compatible with Scala.js/Javascript runtimes and with the Cats library. It also makes use of Scala&rsquo;s Future to represent results, the two being complementary.<br /><br />In this talk I'll show you its design, when you should use it and why in dealing with asynchronicity it's better to work with Task instead of blocking threads.</dd>

It has been tested rigorously and deployed in production at many companies for years. And yet, fault-tolerance issues are still surfaced. How did these faults slip through?<br /><br />The purpose of this talk is not to examine Spark in detail, but rather to see what lessons can be learned for building your own systems, and what you should know as a user of one. We'll explore what a platform can reasonably guarantee, and what types of questions a user should be asking to understand their system. We'll see how Scala and FP principles are used in Spark; and also why Spark abandons some concepts, like immutability. All of these topics will be explored by looking at cases in Spark -- both how the code was designed initially, and issues that were discovered later and fixed.</dd>

Indeed, it is one thing to learn what a "catamorphism" or a "natural transformation" is, and another one to use it in our daily programming. <br /><br />In this talk you will learn how to decompose a REST microservice into several components: authentication, request to other services and database access. Then we will use the Eff monad to precisely define the interface of these components and support additional concerns like logging or asynchronous execution. <br /><br />Once you get the basic idea, the possibilities are endless! Rate limiting is just another component and another set of effects involving time and state. And testing is so much easier: no execution context or mocks!</dd>

Finally we'll talk about the joined work with Scala Center to use CBT for bootstrapping Dotty and how we did it.</dd>

But design of these systems might be challenging as it requires particular mindset shift to tackle problems we might not be used to. In this talk we&rsquo;re going to discuss the most common things I&rsquo;ve seen in the field that prevented applications to work as expected. I&rsquo;d like to talk about typical pitfalls that might cause troubles, about trade-offs that might not be fully understood or important choices that might be overlooked including persistent actors pitfalls, tackling of network partitions, proper implementations of graceful shutdown or distributed transactions, trade-offs of micro-services or actors and more. <br /><br />This talk should be interesting for anyone who is thinking about, implementing, or have already deployed reactive application. My goal is to provide a comprehensive explanation of common problems to be sure they won&rsquo;t be repeated by fellow developers. The talk is a little bit more focused on Lightbend platform but understanding of the concepts we are going to talk about should be beneficial for everyone interested in this field.</dd>

We'll talk about how Scala can succeed in a highly regulated, generally risk-averse environment, and why it can be worth that risk and lead to a happier, healthier team.<br /><br />Still not sure if this talk will be worth your time? You might enjoy this talk if you believe in Life Beyond Java, but the rest of your team thinks that Java 8 Lambdas killed Scala and you are looking for moral support. <br /><br />On the other hand, this talk may be less relevant for you if you believe that Java 8 Lambdas killed Scala and you&rsquo;re tired of hearing from that one teammate who keeps trying to convince you otherwise.

Other libraries like Scalaz, Monix, and FS2 bring us Task abstractions, which are similar to Futures but lazily executed. How do all these variants relate to one another? When should we use one over another? How do we interoperate when we have to deal with code that uses a different variant?<br /><br />Starting from the basics of how to use each variant, we'll build up an understanding of how to select the best one for a codebase, how to make them work together, and some of the pitfalls. Along the way we'll even see some other tricks for making these useful abstractions when combined with other effects.</dd>

These libraries have several disadvantages. For a start, they require switching environments. Furthermore, they often lack useful abstractions, being either easy to use or flexible, but not both. For example, matplotlib provides a rigid system of predefined graphs, while d3 provides many low-level building blocks but lacks tools to easily combine them for common graphs.<br /><br />Doodle is a new 2D visualisation library for Scala. It can render graphs on the desktop, to files (PDF and PNG), and, using Scala.js, to the browser as SVG. In this talk I will briefly describe how to use Doodle for common tasks, and then delve into its architecture. I'll show how standard functional programming techniques allows Doodle to provide powerful functionals at multiple levels of abstraction, yielding a library that is both easy to use and extremely flexible.</dd>

In this session we'll live code our way into type safing everything - conveniently and in the most simple ways. No implicits, no shapeless, no type-level programming, just vanilla Scala code.&nbsp;<br /><br />As it turns out Typesafe config, pure config, etc are actually not type safe. We'll see why and what to do instead. A different concept can be applied to make process and rest calls joyfully convenient and elegantly type-safe at the same time. To the point that Scala can become the more convenient choice over bash for shell scripting.</dd>

In this talk, Bill Venners will describe what he has come to 2believe is the essence of testing, and how he wants to evolve ScalaTest as a result. He'll dive into propositional and predicate logic and show how they relate to testing. He'll explain where he thinks property-based testing fits in the big picture, and give demos of some new and exciting features currently being developed for ScalaTest and Scalactic.</dd>

He has been instrumental in establishing Pluralsight&rsquo;s data initiative by architecting a platform that is used to capture valuable insights on real-time video analytics while integrating several data sources within the business.<br /><br />Before joining Pluralsight, Alex was a principal data engineer at Rackspace, leading a team of developers responsible for building the company&rsquo;s data initiative. Alex has built a reputation as a passionate and pragmatic data evangelist. He was a key asset in establishing Rackspace&rsquo;s big data platform by helping architect a solution used to drive actionable insight on consumer behavior and product-usage trends. He has also designed several analytical models, APIs, and frameworks that enable Rackspace to deliver its award-winning Fanatical Support&reg;, including a computational linguistics library used to analyze and classify support chat logs.<br /><br />Alex was also a principal software engineer at ESPN Emerging Technologies. In that role, he architected and developed a distributed application to help basketball operators collect play-by-play records for data warehousing and modeling purposes. Alex has also held several senior-level engineering positions at Walt Disney World Internet Group, Pentaho, OutStart, and Travelatro.com, all based in Orlando, Florida.<br /><br />Alex is Sun Certified as an Enterprise Architect for the J2EE platform and is also a web component developer and a Java 2 programmer. He earned a bachelor&rsquo;s degree in molecular biology and an MBA from the University of Central Florida in Orlando.<br /><br />When Alex is not programming, you&rsquo;ll probably catch him with an athletic bag on his shoulders. He is a little bit of a sports junkie, particularly a CrossFit addict, who has been known to create an epidemic of fitness recovery, smoking cessation, and weight loss around him.</dd>

The need for real-time, transport-agnostic data protocols have become a crucial feature shared across many different use cases.<br /><br />During this talk, we will discuss our approach to bootstrapping and bounded context subscription, leveraging a mix of open source technologies and home-grown services aimed at providing a full end-to-end solution.<br /><br />We will demonstrate and discuss our use of Kafka, Spark Streaming and Akka to orchestrate a unified data transfer protocol that frees developers from having to listen to and process events within their bounded contexts. More specifically:<br /><br />- Leveraging Kafka as the source of truth<br /> - Topic formats, retention rules and derived topics<br /> - Using Kafka's distributed commit logs to produce durable datasets<br />- Log compaction and its role in service bootstrapping<br />- Message delivery guarantees using Akka actors<br />- Ingestion at scale: consuming data in different formats across different teams at different latencies<br />- Using Spark Streaming and Akka to perform real-time analysis and implement transfer protocols</dd>

It was at that time that CTO and co-founder, Dag Liodden, made the decision to use Scala, which arguably provided the technical foundation needed to scale Tapad to what it is today -- a 200+ person company, managing 20+ PB of data, that was recently acquired for $360 million. While adoption has gained significant momentum for Scala since Tapad first embraced the language, it is still in the fairly early stages of maturity, which poses challenges for experienced and novice Scala developer teams alike. <br /><br />In this session, Dag will address the source of some of these challenges, how they can be resolved, and how Scala can help deliver high quality code at high velocity. Ultimately, all leading up to how engineers and entrepreneurs alike can overcome these barriers to build a team, or even a whole company, on Scala.</dd>

The runtime implications of many Scala features may not be clearly understood. We investigate Java bytecode produced by the Scala compiler to better understand how Scala creates runnable code. We examine Scala language fundamentals, composition and inheritance, scopes, annotations, and Java interoperability. This is achieved using the javap command to disassemble the .class file to look at its signature, a decompiler, and scalac options. Our goal is to demystify language features and produce better runnable code.</dd>

He is fluent in many programming languages, with Scala being his favorite for its combination of functional and object-oriented concepts. Shadaj hosts his projects on GitHub, and has a channel on YouTube. He has presented at OSCON 2014, Scala Days (2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016), Scala By the Bay, and the Bay Area Scala Enthusiast group showing his Scala projects. Besides programming, he enjoys math and participates in science research competitions. Shadaj is currently the VP of Software Engineering of Lynbrook Robotics, his high school robotics team. He has interned at Khan Academy, Coursera, and Paya Labs working with technologies such as React.js, Play! Framework, and Scala.js to develop educational platforms. In addition, he is also an active member of his school community and has been Student Body President. Shadaj loves spreading his love of technology and started TechTalks &mdash; a program that brings guest speakers to share their knowledge and enthusiasm with students at his school.

                                  <dd class="abstract">Streaming data is found everywhere: IOT devices, self-driving cars, social media, financial markets, and more. Processing such data involves aggregation, extraction of statistical data, online learning, behavior prediction, and acting on results on-the-fly -- forming a processing pipeline. Functional Programming can be used to effectively deal with these pipelines.<br /><br />In this talk, I will show how functional programming concepts can be used with streaming data, with a specific application of real-time robot control, where all data is streaming. I will introduce Potassium, a Scala framework that facilitates the use of Scala collection-like APIs for processing sensor and computer vision data and sending control signals to actuators. We will explore how robot control systems can be modeled with functional concepts such as applicative functors. The net effect is elegant decomposition of robot systems where components can be implemented and tested in isolation but easily connected in production.<br /><br />Classical robot algorithms such as digital filters and controllers map directly to functional programming concepts and can be implemented concisely while maintaining high performance. We will explore streaming data used with Akka actors and streams for communication between multiple processing units on a robot and for streaming live data for diagnostics. Finally, we will take a quick look at how React can be used with Scala.js for implementing reusable components for displaying streaming data with &ldquo;Funky Dashboard&rdquo;, an open-source streaming data visualization tool that can be easily deployed in your own environment.</dd>

It should also be able to recover from any errors that occur during the activities, including network disconnection, hardware I/O errors and any other failures in each module. Akka works greatly to manage these types of errors.&nbsp;<br /><br />The BONX app, which is built using Akka, detects failures in each module, and suspend or restarts the connection depending on its network environment, or recover from errors immediately without spoiling the user's experience.<br /><br />That's why the BONX app is rated almost five stars as of January 2017 at <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.bonx.go" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Play</a>.<br />&nbsp;<br />This talk is not just an introduction to a unique use case, but also demonstrates how Akka is a powerful and easy toolkit that can be used to ensure resiliency and concurrency in a minimal system.</dd>

In Scala's early days, the Cake Pattern was quite fashionable; but there was just too much boilerplate. Instead, maybe we could just use plain constructors for wiring dependencies (MacWire)? Use a hybrid service locator (SubCut, Scaldi)? Or go fully functional, and use the Reader Monad; but is it really a replacement of Dependency Injection frameworks/libraries? Finally, maybe we should stick with proven Java-land solutions, like Guice (used e.g. by the Play Framework)?<br /><br />In this live-coding talk I'll try to clear the above doubts (at least partially) and propose some practical solutions. We'll go through wiring a simple application using constructor-based dependency injection, reader-monad based dependency injection, and finally mixing the two for the best results.</dd>

Multiple aspects of our development workflow, including code browsing, code review and code evolution, can be significantly improved if we go beyond just grep and ctags.

                                  <dd class="abstract">Feature vectors &ndash; sequences of heterogenous types &ndash; are the basic unit of any machine learning algorithm. Further, feature engineering involves manipulations of these feature vectors and is a fundamental step in optimizing the accuracy of machine learning models. These manipulations may take the form of regular Scala sequence operations that can also be distributed using frameworks such as Spark or Flink. When building a general purpose machine learning framework, the types of engineered features is not known in advance, which is a problem for statically typed languages. In this talk, I will walk through possible solutions for designing type-safe feature vectors in Scala that provide compile-time type safety for feature engineering and other machine learning use cases. The solutions will demonstrate applications of Shapeless, Scala Macros, and Quasiquotes.</dd>

How do you continue when you are finished writing the code and it does what it is supposed to do? The only remaining obstacle is to get it into the hands of others, but the technical details involved in this can be overwhelming the first time. Where do you publish it, and how? What about tests, test infrastructure, documentation, licensing, versioning, releasing? How do you perform these steps manually? Can you automate them? In this session we will look at and perform live all the necessary steps to take your code from a bunch of Scala source files to an open source Scala project.</dd>

Scala, e.g., is interoperable with Java and has become an early leader in adoption, especially in the start-up and open-source spaces.<br /><br />As educators, we have recognized Scala&rsquo;s value as a teaching language across the CS curriculum. In CS1, the read-eval-print loop and simple, uniform syntax aid programming in the small. In CS2, higher-order methods allow concise, efficient manipulation of collections. In a programming languages course, advanced constructs facilitate the separation of concerns, program representation and interpretation, and concurrent programming. In advanced applied courses, language mechanisms and suitable libraries support the development of mobile apps, web apps, and web services.<br /><br />Based on our own experiences in the classroom, we discuss what works and what needs improvement, and hope to discuss the best ways for industry and higher education to partner in an effort to meet the growing demand for Scala talent.</dd>

So far the documentation and discussion center mostly around using it for code analysis and transformation (scalafix), but code generation is an equally if not more important subject for metaprogramming. <br /><br />I will do a live demo walking to walk you through the basics, demonstrate how nice and composable the scalameta DSL is, and describe some more advanced use cases / ideas. It is still very early days for scalameta, so we'll have a discussion about other potential use cases and differences to old style macros which are still more widely used and known. <br /><br />I published <a href="https://github.com/mpollmeier/scalameta-serialiser" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">scalameta-serialiser</a>, an easy to use library that generates functions to serialise and deserialise any case class, and wrote a <a href="http://www.michaelpollmeier.com/2016/12/01/scalameta-code-generation-tutorial" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post</a> about code generation with scalameta.</dd>

This talk focuses on techniques for achieving optimized high performance in distributed systems while dependably providing required guarantees and ideally keeping the costs for resources, including CPUs, GPUs, memory and storage low.<br /><br />Firstly, the presentation introduces and in depth explains selected optimization techniques used in state of the art large scale stream and fast data processing frameworks such as Akka Streams, Spark or Flink, including configuration, deployment, logical and physical level optimizations. Consequently, powerful optimization concepts applicable to general distributed systems, including those built using Akka, are presented and demonstrated on examples. Finally the role of machine learning and artificial intelligence in the optimizations area is highlighted.<br /><br />The attendees will gain understanding of the available optimization approaches and tradeoffs and ultimately will be able to apply some of the techniques to optimize their own system, whether general distributed systems written in Scala, systems based on Akka or any of the aforementioned technologies.</dd>

It shouldn't be this way.<br /><br />Case classy is a small library that makes part of this process easier. Case classy makes loading and decoding configuration data&mdash;usually strings&mdash;much easier. It prevents all-or-nothing runtime errors and instead provides a rich and comprehensive error data type for when this process goes wrong.<br /><br />In this talk we will introduce Case Classy, showing how to use it and its benefits over other configuration libraries. We will dive into the functional programming foundations and how this enables us to assemble and combine decoders so that errors accumulate. And we will look at how Shapeless and generic programming can automatically assemble decoders for us and save us from an abyss of boilerplate.</dd>

             <h2>Code of Conduct</h2>
<p>Our Code of Conduct is inspired by the kind folks at NE Scala, who adopted theirs from PNW Scala. We think they both nailed it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nobody likes bad behavior, so please show respect for those around you. This applies to both in-person and online behavior.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Scala Days is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion (or lack thereof). We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All communication should be appropriate for a technical audience, including people of many different backgrounds. Sexual language, innuendo, and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Participants violating these rules may be asked to leave without a refund at the sole discretion of the organizers.</p>
